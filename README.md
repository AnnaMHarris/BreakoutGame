# BreakoutGame

A Java Object Oriented, graphics game involving a paddle, ball, and set of blocks.  Gives the player three lives.  Player moves the paddle back and forth using the left and right arrow keys.  A ball bounces off the top and sides of the panel.  The objective of the game is to clear all the block from the panel.  This is done by using the paddle to keep the ball in the panel so it hits and removes the blocks.  If the paddle is not blocking the ball from going downwards it will travel off the board and regenerate a new ball.  The player loses a life everytime the ball goes off the board.  Game will dispay "You Win" when the blocks are cleared from the panel.  If all threee lives are used and the blocks are not all cleared it will display "You Lose."
